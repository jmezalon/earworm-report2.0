# earworm-report2.0

This project was was a final challenge on my first bootcamp, Pursuit 3 years ago. This is the link to the original [earworm-report](https://github.com/jmezalon/Earworm-report).

I wanted to do it over to see how much I've grown as developer since then. During this 3 year period I stopped coding for a year in a half. Being that coding is my passion, I could not stop thinking about working as a developer while I was driving for Uber.
Consequently, I joined Flatiron school and begun coding again. Anyone could see the growth, if you look at the code that I have in the original version above in contrast to this one. I have more components in this iteration, I repeat less code (DRY) and the way I structure my components made it easier for me to reused the SonList component over and over.

The Readme in the original project is more descriptive about what is happening in the project as for as endpoints and what my models would look like. The functionalities are pretty much very simular. The biggest different is that I added a robust authentication in this version. I also used ruby on rails for the backend instead of express and nodeJs.

Overall, it was really fun working on this project again. I faced some challenges that I was not expecting since it is the second time I'm doing this project. However, I was able to find solution to the problems and ultimately finished my functionalities in less than a week.

Go ahead, take a look at the app/code. Create an account, post songs, like them, comment on them and enjoy.
